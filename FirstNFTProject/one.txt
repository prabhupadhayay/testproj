Its is asking to login via Meta mask, where do I signup on site ?
Its already connected by metamask thats why it is automatically sigining in
 called all the methods to deploy smart contract and mint .
pending - 1.transfer

We dont need login / signup vioa meta mask. Meta makks is just for payment
How do I signup to the website ?
For signup - we just need wallet address and we are getting it from metamask 
I can add a manual field of wallet address though .but this is what we need to login to opensea also
Open opensea.op

We shall get user / password model on sigup and have user fill manual wallet address he has from any ETH supported wallet. 
But dont puut energy on that now. as we need prototype this week. Meta Mask is ok for now.ok

I see it same how we discussed before. How is selling going . the form we discussed .Working on it .as I find better .here is the different methods available for transfer ownership . we will mint to first owner than we will transfer that token to third/fourth by owner's approval .


who has rights to transfer ?
the contract creator on this platform (platform has all the rights through all transactions)
ok so creator of the NFT and platform both can transfer and Creator can list his nft to any other platform as well ?
yes
